##  WHAT'S OUR GAME ABOUT?  ##


The War of Roses: Acts of Ambition is an isometric tactical RPG that takes inspiration from 16 and 32 bit rpgs 
like FireEmblem and Advanced Wars. The game will be a short 1h experience were players will be able to participate 
in tactical combat based on unit and resource management. The game toys with the concept of the 4th wall as it's a 
representation of a representation of The Wars of the Roses, a play from William Shakespeare, adapted by John Barton 
which is in itself a representation of the english Civil War of the Roses between the riegel houses of York and Lancaster 
during 15th century England.  The player will play the part of house Tudor allied with house Lancaster as they drive off 
the York family who usurped the throne. The structure of gameplay and its combats will follow a simplification of some of 
the most important and decisive battles of the war of the roses, like Northampton, Wakefield or Bossworth. Characters in 
your party will be acted out by actors of your choosing , the actors are chosen when starting the game.
